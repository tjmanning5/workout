//option tag is gonna need to have a get many method for each exercise and then list each one as a drop down select
//need to set up an input field for new exercises
//need to display sets once exercise is chosen from drop down
//once exercise is selected, input fields for reps/weight, with ability to multi add for multiple sets
//maybe, just maybe, try and display data on graph of weight over time
